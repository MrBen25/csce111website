        <h3 >Vision Goal,</h3>
        <p>This project aims to provide people with the Coffee Coil, a device that is placed into a drink and is able to heat the drink to a temperature designated by the user but not to exceed 150F. The Coffee coil is designed to be a small (5 inch in total length) and portable usb powered device.

        <ul>
            Our Goal:
            <li>To have a functional prototype within 2 months</li>
            <li>To have a refined final product by 4 months</li>
            <li>To be available on the market with a backstock of roughly 10000 available for purchase by the 6 month mark</li>
            <li>To have sold that 10000 and continue at a sustainable growth rate by the 10 month mark</li>
            <li>Goal to sell on average 5000 a month</li>
        </ul>

        The Design:
        <ol>
        <li>Coil- Our team has chosen brass as the material for the coil since brass' surface is anti-microbial, making cleaning much easier. Brass is a good conductor of heat as well, making it great for this application. Brass is a relatively malleable metal making it much easier to mold into the signature coil shape our product has.
        </li>
        <li>USB- USB is the chosen power source for the coffee coil to make it convenient to both office worker and truckers. It also allows the coil to be more portable.
        </li>
        <li>Dial- Our design has a dial located on the top to choose the desired temperature that the coil heats up to. Many people would prefer that their coffee stay at a certain temperature and this allows them to do so. Also, reducing the temperature that the coil runs at will increase the longevity of the product.
        </li>
        <li>Aluminum clip- The aluminum clip allows for the coffee coil to be rested on the lip of any coffee cup. This allows the coffee coil to be easily used and helps prevent any accidents were someone drops the coil into their coffee.
        </li>
        <li>Rubber top- The rubber top of the coffee coil allows for heating insulation from the coil itself. Its works to prevent hand burn as it wont heat up very much around the coil.
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Hot liquids get cold when left out, it's just a fact, but this causes a problem for a lot of people today. No one likes to drink room temperature coffee or tea. Our team has a solution for this common problem, which is a product named the “Coffee Coil''. The coffee coil is a small device that can be hung from the rim of a coffee mug with the coil part lowered into the drink. The coil part will heat up to the desired temperature of the user via its temperature adjustment knob on the top. The coil will not heat up past 150°F as to avoid the potential for causing burns to the user in case of a spill.
        </p>

        <p>The coil shell, which is the only part that will come in contact with the liquid in the cup, will be made from Brass. We specifically chose Brass for its heat conductivity efficiency and its antimicrobial properties. Brass kills bacteria and viruses on contact since brass is mostly copper, guaranteeing that mold or other bacteria won’t grow on the coil, this not only makes cleaning the coffee coil extremely easy, but it also gives our product an edge on the competition since there is no other like it.
        </p>

        <p>Our target market is mainly focused on busy office workers since they are often busy and their coffee gets cold, but we will also focus on the trucking industry since Truckers are on the road for several hours at a time, and currently have no way of keeping their coffee warm. The competition for this market is very small, there are only a limited number of products that accomplish some of what our product does, but they are improperly marketed and therefore not sold in large quantities.
        </p>

        <p>People currently don’t recognize there is a solution to their problem, so we plan to market the coffee coil efficiently to these markets, so people buy the product. We can have the product ready to go within 6 months of funding. The first 2 months would be used to create a functional prototype, 2 months more to refine the prototype to the finished product. The last 2 months would be used for manufacturing the initial batch and distributing to sellers. The coffee coil will be sold in Truck stops to market towards the trucking industry and on Amazon with effective marketing in order to sell to busy office workers.
        </p>

        <p>We estimate a startup cost of 700,000$ to build the facility and purchase all needed manufacturing machines and produce the first 10,000 units of the coffee coil. Every additional 10,000 units would cost approximately 95,000$ (9.5$ a unit) to produce. We plan to market the Coffee Coil for 30$ a unit producing a profit of approximately 3 times the cost to manufacture. We expect to sell 5000 units a month bringing in a monthly income of 150,000$. We project that the product will turn a profit after a little over a year and will make1.9 million after 5 years.
