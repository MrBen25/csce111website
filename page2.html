        <h3 >Shooting,</h3>
        <p>I am a collegiate national champion trap shooter and compete regularly in the sport
            as a member of the Amateur Trap Association. I also occasionally shoot with the NSCA a different league in sporting clays
            which is another shooting discipline.
            I have been shooting since I was in the 7th grade and have loved every minute of it.
            Currently, I am most active with the Texas A&M Trap and Skeet team as well the Texas Trap Association.</p>
